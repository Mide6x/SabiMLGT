# SabiMLGT

Hey there, awesome reader! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the magical world of **SabiMLGT**! ðŸŽ‰

You might be wondering, "Why am I here?" Well, itâ€™s probably because:

- I told you about this amazing project and you just had to check it out.
- You stumbled upon it in a serendipitous internet adventure.
- You work at Sabl and are here on official (or unofficial) business, lol.

So, what's this project all about? Buckle up! ðŸš€

## The Lowdown

**SabiMLGT** is where cutting-edge image classification meets sleek, beautiful UI in a React Native app. We took an already built image classification model (yes, the name's redacted for dramatic effect, lmao) and integrated it into a user-friendly app that not only works like a charm but also looks stunning. ðŸŒŸ

But wait, thereâ€™s more! This project aims to make life easier for:

- You (yes, YOU!).
- Me (because why not?).
- Sellers everywhere (woahhh).

## What's Next?

As time goes on (or by the end of June if weâ€™re feeling ambitious), Iâ€™ll be adding a more detailed and robust README file. Stay tuned for all the juicy details! ðŸ“š

For now, thatâ€™s all folks! Catch you later. ðŸ‘‹âœ¨
